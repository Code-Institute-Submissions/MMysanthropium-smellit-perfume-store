# UX
### Goals For This Website:
The goal is to give the user a nice experience throughout the whole website, on any device. To be able to purchase perfumes from different brands that's been handpicked by the owner, and read news about brands and the evolution of perfumes throughout the world on the blog. 
* Users have the possibility to register for an account to save their information for easier purchases in the future.
* Read posts on the blog and find other useful sources about the difference between perfume and cologne for example.
* Sign up for newsletters to be able to catch all the latest news whenever they get out.
* Contact the owner to give feedback, blog requests or general questions.

## Design
Since I like perfumes and didn't really know anything about it except that they smell good, I thought this would be a great idea for me to be able to research a bit more about the differences and how they are made. That's how I also came up with the idea of adding a blog.

### Wireframes
